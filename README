## Quick build scripts

To build Warzone 2100 Legacy, run *build.sh*.

## Quick fixes

If you experience errors such as the following:

    gcc: error: resource_lexer.lex.c: No such file or directory
    gcc: error: strres_lexer.lex.c: No such file or directory

Extract `lex_c_files.tar.gz` into the build directory to fix the above issue. The archive contains all .lex.c files which some users may find missing.

## Stats generator

If you wish to generate stats, copy your mod into the directory, *stats/mod/*. Create that directory if it does not exist. Inside there, run the script according to the type of stats you wish to generate, using Python 3, with the following command:

    python3 script.py
